            Every day at midnight PT, you can get {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 100}% of
            your total bet amount back as a loan. If your bet has depreciated in
            value, you will get {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 100}% of the lower value.

          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Yes, don't worry! You will automatically pay back loans when the
            question resolves or you sell your bet.

            ‚Ä¢ What is the purpose of loans?
          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Loans make it worthwhile to bet on questions that won't resolve for
            months or years, because your investment won't be locked up as long.
          </span>
          <span className={'text-primary-700'}>‚Ä¢ What is an example?</span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            For example, if you bet {ENV_CONFIG.moneyMoniker}1000 on "Will I
            become a millionaire?", you will get {ENV_CONFIG.moneyMoniker}
            {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 1000} back tomorrow.
          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Previous loans count against your total invested amount. So on the
            next day, you would get back {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 100}% of{' '}
            {ENV_CONFIG.moneyMoniker}(1000 - {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 1000}) =
            {ENV_CONFIG.moneyMoniker}
            {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * (1000 - LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 1000)}.
